# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-assignment
Week 4 assignment 


Downloaded data is saved in the disk. 

First, I read the data seperately for test and training, and assign column names and subject id and activity id.

Then data is merged to one data set. 

Following this, required data elements are kept.

Finally, average of each variable for each subject Id and activity id is created and saved as tidy data.
